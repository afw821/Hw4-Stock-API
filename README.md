# Stock Search Application

## Overview

I created a stock search application using the [iexTrading API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#stocks). Users can input a valid stock symbol in the add stock symbol input field and it will add it to the list of already displayed stock buttons. The user can click on the stock button and it will display real-time stock information on an easy to read table. The user can also input a stock symbol and add it to a favorites list. the user also has the ability to clear the list by clicking the clear button.

## Other features

Only valid stock symbols can be added to both the stock symbols list and the favorites list. If a user inputs a stock symbol that doesn't exist it won't show up on the list. All valid stock symbols will automatically be converted to uppercase when the user adds them.
